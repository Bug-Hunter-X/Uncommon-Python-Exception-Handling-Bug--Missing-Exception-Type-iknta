This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates an uncommon error in exception handling. The function attempts to divide two numbers, but it does not handle all possible exceptions, specifically the TypeError that occurs when a non-numeric type is used in the division operation. The solution demonstrates how to handle this error appropriately by adding another `except` block.
